I try to change the value of auth_name to admin but it said cannot decode cookie
cookie but encrypted :(

notice that the original value of auth_name is U3JJR1k5NnF1Y3laaTU0VjNKczRXRXY1d21jbGlxMXh1SDFUYlgwUEE3VWJmS2l2dFBac3IxY3cyVUxSdW1Fc3dsbUs2U1NOOXdSLzFrR0R1QXpnTVAyUnZIbklQTEpTeWNMNWd3QVg1S1RXRVlaVnkzL0prRDhxdjJCYmQ5UGM=
well, it ends with '=' , I try do decode it (base 64) but get trash value:

Look at the description again:I forgot Cookies can Be modified Client-side, so now I decided to encrypt them!

c,b and c are captialized ? Is there something being hidden? I searched for CBC.
Sad but i'm stuck now

This guy give a clear solution:
