read the source code, we have this:
 		    
int total_cost = 0;
total_cost = 900*number_flags;
printf("\nThe final cost is: %d\n", total_cost);
if(total_cost <= account_balance){
account_balance = account_balance - total_cost;
printf("\nYour current balance after transaction: %d\n\n", account_balance);
}

so total_cost is 4-byte type, we will make it overflow and then account balance
will increase :D
I try with 10^8 then buy the 1337 flag
