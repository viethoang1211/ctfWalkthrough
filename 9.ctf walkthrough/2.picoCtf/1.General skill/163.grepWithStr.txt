chmod +x ltdis.sh
chmod +x static

./ltdis.sh -> know how to use

./ltdis.sh static -> string in file

cat "filename"

But we have another better solution:
we will use the strings command, often used with strings, grep is a useful
tool to search for a string or a pattern of string in a huge blob of data

To combine output of strings and grep, i.e using the output of strings 
as input to our grep command,we use a bash utility called piping. 
To pipe output, we use the ' | ' symbol.
Since the flag format ( picoCTF{ ) is known to us we search for it.

code: $ strings static | grep "picoCTF"
->picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_98d35619}
